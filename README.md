Dimension Reduction Approach for Interpretability of Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural Networks
## Synthetic
Visualzation: code of interpretation of synthetic data (circle and ellipse);
details folder:
* two inputs data (0:circle, 1:ellipse)
* 12 encoder states files at training iterations = (10,100,1000,...,10000)
* 12 decoder states files at training iterations = (10,100,1000,...,10000)
* 12 decoder outputs files at training iterations = (10,100,1000,...,10000)
